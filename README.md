# OLEDShow

This is a simple Android OLED clock app which is able to display a very simple time and
current network status.

This project is done when I studied in Foundation in Brighton, UK. That time,
I want to investigate how suck the network my room did. Considering that,
currently my network is kindly stable and I have a new watch brilliantly, so
that I have no reason to maintain an over-dated and heavy (it is written with
Xamarin, I cannot belive how hard it works on my phone & PC) project. So it is
now archived. If there is any bug, I might work on it, but it will always be
low priority.
